                    Yo.

                <p>
                    My name is Torng-Lin Chen. And I go by "Taffy". It's simply because I wanted an "American name" that starts with 'T' but nothing too fancy. And my mom happens to love the salt water taffy. so...

                    I am originally from Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. Eight and half years ago, I moved to New York to pursue my passion for apparel design. During the time studying at Parsons The New School For Design, I fell in love with hand tailoring. It takes a lot of
                    time and work, but the result is always stunningly rewarding. My professor taught me something that I still apply to life today. He said, "Don't do things quickly, but do it step by step, and correctly. If you rush it, you are most likely going to
                    make mistakes, and do it all over again."

                    However, as careful as one can be, mistakes are not 100% avoidable. As an Engineer, the more mistakes I made in the process, the more I learned. And sometimes, tearing down an app I've beening building for quite a while, and rebuild it up, is the
                    only way to solve problems. Ah, problem solver. I don't mind mistakes, I don't mind admitting "I'm wrong." As long as I figure it out, solve it, make it better, then it is ok to be wrong, I dare to say.

                    I then attended The City College of New York for its wonderful art department. I spent most of my time focusing on photography and sculpture/installations. Even though I take photos, the images are all highly staged by me. The days moving things
                    around in my tiny apartment, to just make one image look exactly like I visioned, are part of my happiest memories. I realized that I enjoy to "get my hands dirty" by actually making things with my hands, literary. To build myself an artist porfolio
                    website, I got to learn a little about web development.

                    Even though some people might not consider programing as making "acutal things" by hand, but to me, I found the same passion that I have in tailoring and photography. I get to make things HAPPEN. The creative thoughts are put into my code, the look
                    of an app, and the functionalities of each little element. The first time I made an web app, I was overly excited and joyful. And that was the moment that I decided to pursue my career in programming.

                    During my time at Grace Hopper Academy, I was trained as a Fullstack Engineer. Fortunately, I had the opportunities to work on projects that are Front End only, and workshops that are pure Back End. It was by far, the most intense 3.5 months in my
                    life. And NOW, I'm excited to start a new chapter of my life working as a Software Engineer.
