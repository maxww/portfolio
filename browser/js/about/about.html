                    Yo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My name is Torng-Lin Chen. And I go by
                    <i>Taffy</i>.

                    I grew up in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, and eight and half years ago, I moved to New York to pursue my passion in apparel design. During my time at Parsons New School of Design, I fell in love with hand tailoring. It takes a lot of time and
                    craftsmanship, but the results are always stunningly rewarding. One of my professor once told me,
                    <p>
                        <i>"Don't do things quickly, but do it step by step, and correctly. If you rush it, you are most likely going to make mistakes..."</i>
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This message stuck to me and I continue to apply it to life today. Today, as a software engineer, I realize mistakes aren’t always avoidable or negative. Bugs and errors are learning experiences; they make me a better problem solver. Through
                    programming, I continue to apply the virtue of patience and persistence. Planning out an application thoroughly and meticulously will bring rewarding results and less setbacks at the end.

                    In 2011, I attended City College of New York to pursue my interest in photography and sculpture/installations. I remember the days where I’ll move things around my tiny apartment, just to capture the images I had visioned. I realized that I enjoy to
                    "get my hands dirty". I like to build things. When I decided to create a website for my art portfolio, I opened a new path to my career, web development.

                    Although most people might not see the similarities amongst tailoring, photography and programming, I share passion for all these things because they all have the commonality of making things happen. The creative thoughts are put into my code, the
                    look of an app, and the functionalities of each little element.

                    I recall how overly excited and joyful I was when I created my first web app. Everything was so magical! That was the moment I knew I wanted to pursue a career in programming.

                    During my time at Grace Hopper Academy, I was trained to become a Fullstack Engineer. I had the opportunities to work on projects that were front end focused, as well as complete workshops that were purely back end. It was by far the most intense
                    three and half months of my life, but I learned tremendously and am now really excited to start my new chapter as a Software Engineer.
